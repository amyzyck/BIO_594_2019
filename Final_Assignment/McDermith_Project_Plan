title: Final Project Plan

Brief Summary
 In low iron marine environments phytoplankton may be able to use compounds produced by bacteria that increase the bioavailability of iron. These iron-binding secondary compounds are known as siderophores. Siderophores are widely produced by many bacteria in a variety of environments including both aquatic and terrestrial habitats. This proposed project aims to analyze a possible mutualistic relationship between bacteria and phytoplankton in the North Atlantic, a well-known iron-limited environment, through genome analysis. I intend to analyze the genome of Salegentibacter, a bacterium isolated from the North Atlantic, to look for genes used to produce secondary compounds such as siderophores. This project will further our understanding of how organisms adapt to low iron environments. 
 
 Goals
 I will identify genes used in siderophore production in my Salegentibacter genome. I will also compare my genome to published genome sequences of the organism. 

Data
The type of data is a whole genome sequence and is accessible from a Jenkins Lab computer. Each read contains approximately 2,600,000 nucleotides.

Methods
FastQc will be used to analyze the initial quality of my sequence
Trimmomatic will be used to trim sequence primers and low quality nucleotides. The quality of trimmed sequences will be analyzed with FastQc.
Velvet will be used for the assembly
BUSCO will be used to assess the assembly quality 
Contigs will be ordered to a known Salegentibacter genome using Mauve
