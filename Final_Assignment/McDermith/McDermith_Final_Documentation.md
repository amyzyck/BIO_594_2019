# A Genome Analysis of *Salegentibacter* sp.
This analysis will cover the following:
1. Data assessment using FastQC
2. Trimmomatic
3. *De Novo* assembly using Velvet
4. Ordering contigs using Abcas
5. Genome annotation using Prokka


Bash scripts were used for many of the analyses and can be found in the Scripts folder.
### 1. FastQc
FastQc was used to asses the initial quality of the genome sequence.
The raw data files for this data set are BJ1_S5_L001_R1_001.fastq.gz BJ1_S5_L001_R2_001.fastq.gz.

```
module load FastQC/0.11.5-Java-1.8.0_92
cd /data3/jenkinslab/emcdermith/McDermithFinalAssignment/RawData/
fastqc BJ1_S5_L001_R1_001.fastq.gz BJ1_S5_L001_R2_001.fastq.gz
```

The HTML for the FastQc of the raw reads can be viewed in the Figures folder.

### 2. Trimmomatic
 Trimmomatic was used to trim low quality reads and adaptor sequences.

  Trimmomatic was run using a bash script called Trimmomatic.sh which can be found in the Scripts folder.
	The adaptors were removed using the appropriate adaptor files. In this case, NexteraPE-PE.fa was used. SLIDINGWINDOW:4:15 means that if between a window of 4 bases there is a quality score below 15 the sequence will be cut. The slidingwindow begins at the 5' end. 
	LEADING:3 removes any bases with a quality score below 3 at the start of the read.
	TRAILING:3 removes any bases with a quality score below 3 at the end of the read.
	MINLEN:36 removes read if it is less than 36 bp in length.

Output files were renamed trimmed_R1_paired.fq.gz  trimmed_R1_unpaired.fq.gz  trimmed_R2_paired.fq.gz  trimmed_R2_unpaired.fq.gz

Trimmed reads were assessed for quality using FastQc

```
module load FastQC/0.11.5-Java-1.8.0_92
cd /data3/jenkinslab/emcdermith/McDermithFinalAssignment/Trimmomatic/
fastqc trimmed_R1_paired.fq.gz trimmed_R2_paired.fq.gz
```

The HTML for the FastQc of the trimmed reads can be found in the Figures folder.

### 3. Velvet
Before running Velvet trimmed files must be interleaved. I used the shuffleSequences_fastq.pl script which can be found within the Velvet package or in my Scripts folder.

```
perl shuffleSequences_fastq.pl ../Trimmomatic/trimmed_R1_paired.fq.gz ../Trimmomatic/trimmed_R2_paired.fq.gz new_interleaved_R1R2_fq.gz
```

This created an interleaved file called new_interleaved_R1R2_fq.gz which can now be used in the assembly.

I had trouble with velvet assembling zipped files. Velvet was not able to read the entire zipped file. To solve this I unzipped the files and interleaved the unzipped files.

```
gzip -d *_paired.fq.gz 
perl shuffleSequences_fastq.pl ../Trimmomatic/trimmed_R1_paired.fq ../Trimmomatic/trimmed_R2_paired.fq new_interleaved_R1R2_fq
```

This produced an interleaved unzipped file called new_interleaved_R1R2_fq that was used in the assembly.

To assemble with velvet you first run velveth and then veletg.

Running velveth:
```
module load velvet/1.2.10 
velveth auto 45,51,2 -shortPaired -fastq -interleaved new_interleaved_R1R2_fq
```
This runs hash lengths between 45 and 51 in increments of 2.
Each analysis created it's own directory with 3 output files prodcued by velveth. For example, in this analysis directories auto_45  auto_47  auto_49 were created. Within each directory are Log,  Roadmaps and  Sequences files.

I tried using a script avaliable through Velvet to estimate the expected k-mer coverage to use in the velvetg step. I used velvet-estimate-exp_cov.pl script which can be found in my Scripts folder.
```
perl velvet-estimate-exp_cov.pl /data3/jenkinslab/emcdermith/McDermithFinalAssignment/VelvetOptimiser/auto_49/stats.txt 

Below is the output:

Predicted expected coverage: 1
velvetg parameters: -exp_cov 1 -cov_cutoff 0 
```

Next, velvetg was run. 
Running velvetg:
Instead of using the expected coverage I calculated I decided on using -exp_cov auto. By using this velvetg will automatically estimate the expected kmer coverage (note this is different from the actual read coverage), the insert sizes of the individual paired-end and mate-pair runs and the coverage cut off, a parameter that is used to filter low coverage contigs from your assembly.

```
velvetg auto_45 -exp_cov auto 
For auto_45 Final graph has 391722 nodes and n50 of 45, max 872, total 10690707, using 4058652/5006058 reads
```
```
velvetg auto_47 -exp_cov auto 
For auto_47 Final graph has 375127 nodes and n50 of 47, max 870, total 10744285, using 3972675/5006058 reads
```
```
velvetg auto_49 -exp_cov auto
For auto _49 Final graph has 361337 nodes and n50 of 49, max 868, total 10828749, using 3919900/5006058 reads
```

Velvetg outputs the following files:
```
contigs.fa,  Graph2,  LastGraph,  Log,  PreGraph,  Roadmaps,  Sequences and  stats.txt
```
Since the N50 was getting better with higher hash length I ran the assembly using hash lengths of 51 and 53.

```
velveth auto 51,55,2 -shortPaired -fastq -interleaved new_interleaved_R1R2_fq 
velvetg auto_51 -exp_cov auto 
Final graph has 353142 nodes and n50 of 51, max 814, total 11071237, using 3799730/5006058 reads
```

```
velvetg auto_53 -exp_cov auto 
Final graph has 345503 nodes and n50 of 53, max 812, total 11432921, using 3632011/5006058 reads
```

### 4. Contigs were ordered using Abacas
Contigs from the auto_49 assembly were used for the rest of the analysis. These contigs were ordered against a reference genome downloaded from NCBI. A genome of Salegentibacter salinarum was downloaded from NCBI. The file can be found here: <https://https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NZ_LT670848.1?report=fasta>

```
module load ABACAS/1.3.2 
module load  MUMmer/3.23 
abacas.1.3.2.pl -r SalegentibactersalegensstrainACAM48.fasta -q contigs.fa -p 'nucmer' -m -b -o orderedcontigs.fa
```

-m produces a list of ordered and orientated contigs in a multi-fasta format. 
-b produces a multi-fasta file of all unmapped contigs. 
Running Abcas produced the following files: 
```
orderedcontigs.fa.bin orderedcontigs.fa.contigsInbin.fas orderedcontigs.fa.crunch      orderedcontigs.fa.MULTIFASTA.fa orderedcontigs.fa.fasta       orderedcontigs.fa.tab orderedcontigs.fa.gaps        SalegentibactersalegensstrainACAM48.fasta orderedcontigs.fa.gaps.stats orderedcontigs.fa.gaps.tab unused_contigs.out
```

### 5. Annotation using Prokka
```
prokka --listdb 
[13:01:12] Looking for databases in: /Users/emilymcdermith/prokka/db
[13:01:12] * Kingdoms: Archaea Bacteria Bacteria Bacteria Mitochondria Viruses 
[13:01:12] * Genera: Enterococcus Escherichia Staphylococcus 
[13:01:12] * HMMs: HAMAP 
[13:01:12] * CMs: Bacteria Viruses 

Shown above are the databases that were used for the annotation.
```

```
prokka contigs.fa --outdir prokka_annotation
```

In the new directory, prokka_annotation the following files were made: 
```
PROKKA_05092019.err	PROKKA_05092019.fsa	PROKKA_05092019.sqn
PROKKA_05092019.faa	PROKKA_05092019.gbk	PROKKA_05092019.tbl
PROKKA_05092019.ffn	PROKKA_05092019.gff	PROKKA_05092019.tsv
PROKKA_05092019.fna	PROKKA_05092019.log	PROKKA_05092019.txt
```
Below is a description of what each file contains. 
.faa = Protein FASTA file of the translated CDS sequences. 
.ffn = Nucleotide FASTA file of all the prediction transcripts (CDS, rRNA, tRNA, tmRNA, misc_RNA) 
.fna = Nucleotide FASTA file of the input contig sequences. 
.gbk = This is a standard Genbank file derived from the master .gff. If the input to prokka was a multi-FASTA, then this will be a multi-Genbank, with one record for each sequence. 
.gff = This is the master annotation in GFF3 format, containing both sequences and annotations. It can be viewed directly in Artemis or IGV.
.log = Contains all the output that Prokka produced during its run. This is a record of what settings you used, even if the --quiet option was enabled. 
.tbl = Feature Table file, used by "tbl2asn" to create the .sqn file. 
.tsv = Tab-separated file of all features: locus_tag,ftype,len_bp,gene,EC_number,COG,product. 
.txt = Statistics relating to the annotated features found. 


Below is a view of the some of the proteins that were identified in the PROKKA_05092019.faa file.
