# Final Assignment Outline

**Eren Ada**


**Brief Summary**

The aim of this study is to demonstrate human population structure across the geographic regions using SNP data.


**Summarize the type of data, the location, and the size of the data set
Analysis Plan**

Here, I will use the whole-genome sequences from 25 different human populations. Data were generated by The 1000 Genomes Project Consortium (2015).

**Briefly outline your analysis plan with a one-line justification for each step.**

- Downloading & quality trimming of the data: FastQC will be used to trim the data.
- Reads will be mapped to human reference genome using Bowtie software.   
- SNPs will be called & filtered with appropriate criteria.
- Final VCF files will be used to demonstrate population structure among human populations.
