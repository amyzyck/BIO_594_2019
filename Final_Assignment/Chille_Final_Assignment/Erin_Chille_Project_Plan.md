Population Structure and Gene Flow in *Acropora cervicornis*  
Author: E. Chille  

#### Brief Summary
Vital to Caribbean coral reef ecosystems, Acroporids provide numerous ecological functions including provision of food and complex habitat for commercially and recreationally important invertebrates and fishes. Since the 1980s, Acroporids have lost 80-98% of their 1970s-baseline population throughout their range, and where quantitative data is available, only 3% of the original population persists. After a major bleaching event in 2005, both *A. palmata* and *A. cervicornis* were listed in the ESA as threatened species with the key conservation objective of facilitating reproduction through conservation of substrate. Major threats to Acroporids include disease, temperature-induced bleaching, and physical damage from hurricanes, while moderate threats include physical anthropogenic damage, competition from coastal development, increased sedimentation, contaminants, and nutrients, sea level rise, and competition with macroalgae.   (Ctr. for Biological Diversity v. Nat’l Marine Fisheries Serv., 977 F. Supp. 2d 55, 2013). The persistence of Acroporids in the face of these stressors lies in their resistance and
resilience to disturbance. Recruitment and genetic connectivity between populations are key to maintaining the resistance and resilience of Acroporids by regulating standing genetic diversity (Drury, Paris, Kourafalou, & Lirman, 2018).

The goal of this analysis is to quantify genetic structure and gene flow between populations of *A. cervicornis* in the Caribbean to infer the resilience and resistance of this species to environmental and anthropogenic stressors.

#### Data description
The data for this study will be obtained through NCBI BioProject 473816: [Genome-wide survey of Caribbean Acroporids](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject?LinkName=sra_bioproject&from_uid=5628611). Five *A. cervicornis* nubbins were collected from four regions in the Caribbean including Florida, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Belize, and Curacao (Kitchen et al., 2019).

DNA was extracted from each sample using the Qiagen DNeasy kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. DNA quality was assessed using gel electrophoresis and quantity was assesed with Qubit 2.0 fluorometry (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA). Sequence library construction and sequencing was completed by the Pennsylvania State University Genomics Core Facility. Paired-end short insert (350 nt) sequencing libraries were constructed using 100 ng sample DNA and the TruSeq DNA Nano kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA). Libraries were pooled with ten samples of *A. palamata* and sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 Rapid Run (Illumina, San Diego, CA) over four lanes (Kitchen et al., 2019).
